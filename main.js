## Task 1 - Declaring Objects

In your `main.js`, convert the following sentences into JavaScript objects.

Example:

> My cat is black, his name is Tony, and he loves cuddles.

Becomes...

```js
const myCat = {
  color: "black",
  name: "Tony",
  lovesCuddles: true,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Convert the rest!

âœ…Create an object called `myHouse`:

> My house has 2 stories, no parking, 2 bedrooms, a garden and an energy efficiency rating of D.
*/
const myHouse = {
    stories: 2,
    parking: false,
    bedrooms: 2,
    garden: true,
    energyEfficiency: "D"
}


/*

âœ…Create an object called `myCar`:

> My car is red, has 4 wheels, power steering, and 2 seats, and does 20 miles per gallon.
*/
const myCar = {
    colour: "red",
    wheels: 4,
    extras: "power steering",
    seats: 2,
    fuelIntake: "20 miles per gallon"
}

/*

âœ…Create an object called `myFavouriteFilm`:

> My favourite film's title is The Dark Knight, it was released in 2008, and the lead actor is Christian Bale.
*/
const myFavouriteFilm = {
title: "The Dark Knight",
year: 2008,
leadActor: "Christian Bale",
}
/*

## Task 2 - Reading values

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Copy this object into your JavaScript file.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Ben",
  likesChocolate: true,
};
```
*/
let person = {
    name: "Tom",
    likesChocolate: false,
  }

console.log(person.likesChocolate);
if(person.likesChocolate === true){
    console.log(person.name + " loves chocolate");
}else{
    console.log(person.name + " hates chocolate");
}

/*
ðŸ‘‰âœ… Below that, use dot notation to console.log the value of the `likesChocolate` property. 

ðŸ‘‰âœ… Then write an if statement that will console.log `"Ben loves chocolate"` if likesChocolate has a value of true else console.log `"Ben hates chocolate"`. The condition for the if, and the name Ben should both be read from the object using dot notation.

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Change the object's values and re-run your code. The name and the boolean should affect how your program runs.

## Task 3 - Bracket Notation

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Copy this object into your JavaScript file:

```js
*/
let desiredPleasantry = "farewell";

let bensPhrases = {
  greeting: "Well hello there!",
  farewell: "See you in another life, brother",
  smallTalk: "Warm today, isn't it...",
};
console.log(bensPhrases["smallTalk"]);
console.log(bensPhrases[desiredPleasantry]);
/*
```

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Use bracket notation and the `smallTalk property` to console.log Ben's smalltalk phrase.

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Use bracket notation and the `desiredPleasantry` variable to console.log Ben's greeting phrase.

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Change what is console logged by changing the value of `desiredPleasantry`.

## Task 4 - Reassigning Properties

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Copy the object below, and fill in the blank name values to represent yourself, but do not change the `isBootcamper` key; it must remain as false (just for a little bit...).

```js
*/
let me = {
  firstName: "Monika",
  lastName: "Lament",
  isBootcamper: false,
};

me.isBootcamper = true;
/*
```

ðŸ‘‰âœ… Below your object, reassign the property of `isBootcamper` using the assignment operator. Make it `true`!

## Task 5 - Nested Objects

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… Copy this object into your JavaScript file.

```js
*/

let communication = {
  success: true,
  payload: {
    message: {
      text: "Please send biscuits!",
      priority: "URGENT",
    },
  },
};
let newText = communication.payload.message.text;
if (communication.payload.message.priority === "URGENT"){
    console.log(newText);
}else{

}
/*
```

ðŸ‘‰ âœ…Using dot notation, read the text from the communication object and store it in a variable.

ðŸ‘‰ âœ… If the priority is urgent, then console.log the variable, else do nothing.

## Task 6 - Get Experimental

ðŸ‘‰ Explore objects more. For example, you could...

-âœ… Create multi-layered nested objects, and access properties at different layers.

const employees = {
    employeeNumber1: {
        ID: 11,
        position: "waiter",
        contract: {
            type: "permanent",
            hours: 40,
        },
    } ,
    employeeNumber2: {
        ID: 22,
        position: "chef",
        contract: {
            type: "part-time",
            hours: 20,
        },
    },
    employeeNumber3: {
        ID: 33,
        position: "kitchen porter",
        contract: {
            type: "permanent",
            hours: 37.5,
         },
    },
}
console.log(employees.employeeNumber2.contract["type"]);
console.log(employees.employeeNumber3)
/*
- Create functions that take in information and use that information to create or change objects. For example, you could make a function that took in someone's name and age and return an object for that person with those details as properties.
- Look online in documentation (for example, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)) about objects in JavaScript. Can you find anything new or surprising?
